# Data Pipeline with Reddit API, Airflow, Docker, AWS S3, AWS Glue, AWS Athena, and AWS Redshift

## The pipeline is designed to:

1. Extract data from Reddit using its API.
2. Store the raw data into an S3 bucket from Airflow.
3. Transform the data using AWS Glue and Amazon Athena.
4. Load the transformed data into Amazon Redshift for analytics and querying.
